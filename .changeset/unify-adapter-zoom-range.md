Unify the reachable zoom range across adapters. A new `@stll/folio-core/utils/zoom` module exports the canonical `ZOOM_MIN` (0.25), `ZOOM_MAX` (4), and `ZOOM_STEP` (0.1); React and Vue now source their clamp from it. The Vue adapter previously clamped zoom to 0.5-2x and now matches React at 0.25-4x. Each adapter's curated toolbar zoom-level dropdown (50-200%) is unchanged and remains an intentional subset of the reachable range.
