Broaden the AI-edits read surface for live-editor reuse. Core gains pure `getTrackedChangesFromDoc` / `getCommentAnchorsFromDoc` readers and a `buildAnnotatedBlockText` redline renderer over any ProseMirror `doc`, a `getContentAsText({ annotated })` option that inlines tracked changes and comment anchors as `<ins>`/`<del>`/`<comment>` tags, and a read-only `getNotesAsText` surfacing header/footer and footnote/endnote text. The React and Vue `DocxEditorRef` gain a matching read surface — `getTrackedChanges`, `getCommentAnchors`, `getSelectionText`, and `getPageText(page)` — so a live-editor agent tool can read the current document state without a fresh AI-edit snapshot. `@stll/folio-agents` now exports `parseSuggestChangesInput` / `parseAddCommentInput` — the `suggest_changes` / `add_comment` argument-validation rules factored out of `executeFolioToolCall`, for hosts with their own review-queue UX — and its live-editor bridge now reads real tracked changes and comment anchors from that new `DocxEditorRef` surface instead of reporting them as unavailable.
