# The container contract

folio loses things quietly. A parser walks a container's children, recognises
the ones it models, and lets the rest fall off the end of a `switch`; a
serializer rebuilds the container from the model and writes back only what the
model holds. Neither step reports anything, so the loss shows up as a Word
repair dialog, a reviewer's revision that vanished, or nothing at all.

The contract makes the loss a decision somebody wrote down, and the survival law
checks that decision by running it.

## The two halves

| Half                      | Where                                          | What it guarantees                                                                             |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The survival law          | `scripts/lib/container-survival/`              | Every pair the schema allows is exercised against a real save, and every loss is recorded with the mechanism that caused it. |
| The contract              | `specifications/container-contract/`           | Every one of those pairs has a recorded disposition, and a `dropped` one names why and what would change it. |

They check each other. A pair the contract calls `modelled` or
`captured-verbatim` that the law shows lost fails CI. A pair the contract calls
`dropped` that the law shows surviving fails CI too — otherwise a fix would
leave a stale confession behind and the list would only ever grow.

## The survival law

The law's universe is derived, not listed. `schemaSpace.ts` walks the committed
schema graph (`specifications/generated/docx-transitional-schema.gen.json`, no
network) from the roots of the parts folio rebuilds, scoped exactly the way
`scripts/generate-strict-value-encodings.ts` scopes its own walk. It yields two
kinds of pair:

- **(container, allowed child)** — every element the schema lets a container hold;
- **(element, allowed attribute)** — every attribute the schema lets an element carry.

For each, `fixture.ts` synthesises a minimal package: the cheapest chain of
elements from `w:document` down to the container, each level carrying the
attributes its type requires and the siblings its content model requires, with
the subject at the ordinal its particle declares. A fixture that does not itself
validate is reported as **unrepresentable** and not run, because a law that
fails on the generator's own invalid markup proves nothing.

Then four laws run, reported separately because they fail for different reasons
and are fixed in different places:

- **L1 parse** — `parseDocx` does not throw.
- **L2 serialize** — parse, remove the verbatim captures that replay would hand
  back, save, and find the subject in the saved part with an equal value.
- **L3 editor** — the same through `toProseDoc`/`fromProseDoc`.
- **L4 schema** — the part L2 wrote carries no new schema violation.

L2 is the one with teeth. folio replays captured bytes whenever a fingerprint
says the model still agrees with them, so a round trip over an untouched
document exercises the capture machinery rather than the serializers. The
stripping is the corpus `reserialize` invariant's own forcing mechanism, imported
from `scripts/lib/corpus-invariants/reserialize.ts` rather than restated.

### Loss mechanisms

Each names a different place to fix it:

| Mechanism                            | Means                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `the-container-itself-is-lost`       | The pair went with its container; fix the container and they all follow. |
| `never-parsed`                       | No parser reads it and no capture keeps it.                            |
| `parsed-but-not-serialized`          | The model holds it and no serializer writes it.                        |
| `serialized-only-via-verbatim-replay` | It survives an untouched save and not an edited one.                   |
| `replay-rejected`                    | A capture holds it and a gate refuses the capture, forcing a rebuild that cannot write it. |
| `lost-in-the-editor-projection`      | It survives a save but not the ProseMirror round trip.                 |
| `present-with-a-different-value`     | It comes back respelled.                                               |

### Fixture realism

Two small tables in the generator decide what a fixture looks like, and neither
decides anything the contract decides:

- `DETOUR_ELEMENTS` and `BLOCK_CONTAINERS`/`BLOCK_CHILDREN` in `schemaSpace.ts`
  cost a step through a transparent wrapper more than a step down the
  structural spine. The schema lets a `w:body` hold an `m:oMath` directly and
  lets `m:rad` sit inside a bare `w:ins`; documents put equations in paragraphs.
  Without the weighting, every maths pair would measure how folio treats a bare
  `w:ins` in a body.
- `SEED_CHILDREN` in `fixture.ts` gives a container the content it needs to
  survive at all — a row in a table, a paragraph in a cell, a numbering
  reference in a `w:numPr`. A container folio prunes for being empty would
  report every pair inside it as lost.

### What is skipped, and why

- **Containers reachable only from another part root.** `w:comments`,
  `w:footnotes`, `w:endnotes`, `w:hdr` and `w:ftr` root parts of their own with
  their own content-type overrides and relationships, which the fixture builder
  does not synthesise. Everything below them is also reachable from the body, so
  this leaves only the roots and the children they alone declare.
- **Content models the builder cannot satisfy mechanically.** A generated
  fixture that fails the schema validator is counted as unrepresentable, with
  the violation that made it so, rather than as a passing pair.

Both are counted and printed by reason; neither is silently treated as passing.

## The contract

`specifications/container-contract/contract.json` holds one entry per pair:

```json
"{…}tblGrid|{…}CT_TblGrid/{…}tblGridChange": { "disposition": "captured-verbatim" }
"{…}p|{…}CT_P@{…}rsidR": { "disposition": "dropped", "reason": "neverParsed" }
```

`modelled` means a parser reads it into the typed model and a serializer writes
it back: it survives an edit, the editor, and a rebuild. `captured-verbatim`
means the markup is kept as bytes and replayed — right for a historical record
such as a tracked-change snapshot, wrong for anything a user edits. `dropped`
names a reason class from `DROP_REASONS`, each of which states the mechanism and
the kind of fix.

### Why totality is a check and not a type

`specifications/reserved-values` proves its totality with `as const satisfies
Record<keyof T, …>`, and that is the better mechanism when the key set is a
model's own fields. Here the key set is about three thousand schema pairs. A
generated union that wide, with a `satisfies` over it, would cost more type
instantiations than every published package put together, and the budget may
not be raised to pay for it. So the keys stay strings, the project measures 168
types and 4 instantiations, and totality is enforced by
`bun run check:container-contract`, which costs a census run that has to happen
anyway.

The compiler still owns what a decision may *say*. `ContractEntry` is a
discriminated union, so a `dropped` entry with no reason, or one naming a class
`DROP_REASONS` does not define, fails `bun run typecheck`. And
`REASON_FOR_MECHANISM` in `scripts/container-contract.ts` is
`as const satisfies Record<LossMechanism, DropReason>`: a new way to lose
something cannot be recorded until somebody has given it a name and a fix.

## Adding an element

You do not add it here. Add the parser or serializer support, then run:

```sh
bun run check:container-contract      # names every pair whose behaviour moved
bun run check:container-survival      # the same, per mechanism, against the baseline
```

Each tells you exactly which pairs changed and in which direction. When the
change is the one you meant, record it:

```sh
bun run container-contract:write      # rewrites specifications/container-contract/contract.json
bun run container-survival:baseline   # rewrites specifications/container-contract/survival-baseline.json
```

Both are full sweeps and refuse to write from a scoped run, so a baseline can
never be narrowed by accident. During development, scope the *check* instead:

```sh
bun scripts/container-contract.ts check --only tblGridChange
bun scripts/container-survival-census.ts run --only numberingChange
bun scripts/container-survival-census.ts fixture --only numberingChange   # see the package it builds
```

## How the baselines shrink

`survival-baseline.json` records, per pair, the mechanism that loses it, and
separately the values a surviving slot still loses. The gate fails when a pair
starts being lost, when a recorded loss changes mechanism — a different defect
wearing the old one's name — and when a recorded loss stops happening without
the baseline being rewritten. The last case is what makes a fix lock its own win
in: the list can only go down.

`contract.json` ratchets the same way from the other side. A pair moving from
`dropped` to `modelled` is a failure until it is recorded, and a pair moving the
other way is a failure full stop.

## Where this came from

The public corpus census (423 failure signatures over 3567 packages) found the
instances: `w:moveFromRangeStart` reaching disk without the `w:author` its
schema type requires, `w:tblGridChange` disappearing whenever a column was
resized, `w:numberingChange` disappearing always. The instances were fixed. The
class — a parser that hands an unrecognised child to the floor — needed a census
over the schema rather than over examples, because the corpus can only show what
some document happened to contain.

See also `docs/reserved-values.md`, which holds the same shape for a different
question: there the registry is total over the model and the coverage check is
total over the schema; here the contract is total over the schema and the law is
what verifies it.
